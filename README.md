The goal is to group customers into meaningful segments (e.g., Loyal Customers, At-Risk, Big Spenders) and provide business insights that can help with marketing strategies.

Tech Stack:

Python 

pandas, numpy (data preprocessing)

scikit-learn (KMeans clustering, scaling)

matplotlib, seaborn (visualizations)
